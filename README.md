- **Clean UI ‚ö°**

## Rules To Contribute To This Repo

- You can write solutions in C/C++/Java for Data Structure and Algorithms.
- Follow file naming convention for all your pull requests.
- While adding any content it should be inside its appropiate directory
- if there is any problem with inaccurate solution create an issue!

## file naming convention

| use                | file type                      | comments                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| questions          | **README.md**                  | all questions of particular topic are mentioned in a `README.md` file inside the sub topic folder           |
| C++ solutions      | **[topic name].cpp**           | solution C++ code file code to a question is written in same folder where question is mentioned             |
| algorithm solution | **[topic name]-algorithm.txt** | algorithm solution to a question is written in a `.txt` txt file in same folder where question is mentioned |

## Things you can contribute to

- Repo contain folders of all the data structures and algorithms topics with some pre-addressed questions. You can **add a solution** to a question ( present in the readme of particular topic folder) that is unanswered.
- you can **update existing solution** with a better one ( better complexity).
- Participants can even **add new questions** and solutions of their interest.
- **solve issues** raised by other people or yourself.
- make webpage ( hosted from GitHub readme ) more appealing and updated.
- **Well-documented** source code with detailed explanations provides a valuable resource for educators and students alike.
